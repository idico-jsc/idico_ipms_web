# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Important

**Before planning or coding, READ the relevant documentation:**

## Documentation Files

- **[FRAPPE_INTEGRATION.md](../FRAPPE_INTEGRATION.md)** - Frappe Framework integration with bearer token auth

## Workflow

1. **Read** relevant documentation
2. **Plan** following documented patterns
3. **Code** according to guidelines

## Important Rules

### When Creating Root-Level Documentation Files

**ALWAYS update both files when creating new `.md` files in the project root:**

1. **`.vscode/settings.json`** - Add the new file to `README.md` file nesting pattern:
   ```json
   "README.md": "ARCHITECTURE.md,I18N_GUIDE.md,...,YOUR_NEW_FILE.md"
   ```

2. **`.claude/CLAUDE.md`** - Add the file to the appropriate documentation section with a brief description:
   ```markdown
   - **[YOUR_NEW_FILE.md](../YOUR_NEW_FILE.md)** - Brief description
   ```

This ensures:
- The new documentation is discoverable in VS Code's file explorer (nested under README.md)
- Claude Code knows about the documentation and can reference it
- Documentation is organized and maintainable

### shadcn Components (Atoms)

**DO NOT modify shadcn components downloaded to `src/components/atoms/` unless absolutely necessary:**

- shadcn components are downloaded from the official registry to `src/components/atoms/` and should be treated as library code
- Avoid editing files in `src/components/atoms/` that were generated by shadcn CLI
- If customization is needed, follow this priority order:
  1. **Override className when using the component** (Preferred method)
     - Pass custom className props when using the component
     - Use Tailwind utilities with data attributes for state-specific styling
     - Example: `<SidebarMenuButton className="data-[active=true]:font-normal" />`
  2. **Use styled-components to customize nested elements** (If className override is insufficient)
     - Create styled wrappers for complex customizations
     - Target nested elements without modifying the base component
  3. **Create wrapper components** (For reusable patterns)
     - Create in appropriate feature folders (molecules, organisms, or feature-specific)
     - Use composition instead of modification
  4. **CSS modules or global CSS overrides** (Last resort for complex cases)
     - Apply styling through scoped CSS or global overrides in `index.css`
- Only modify atoms directly if there's a critical bug or unavoidable requirement
- When modifications are necessary, document them clearly in code comments explaining why the change was needed
